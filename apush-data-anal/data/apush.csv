- Heimler was helpful but not necessarily all you need for a 5 or an A. He gives a great overview, but you definitely should use his stuff as a review and NOT your main source. The videos have great info, but you need to be also doing active learning and not just watching/listening. I often listened to the videos the night before or morning of a quiz to refresh my memory of the content.

I have a good attention span on tests, but that doesn't really translate when it's just me at my dining room table haha)
- AP progress checks (6/10) were helpful because they pointed out what I got wrong and provided little explanations. I mostly did these for MCQs & I would recommend them, but I would also make sure to use other resources. I feel like the MCQs were similar to the exam but idk...
